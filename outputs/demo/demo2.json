We can determine the front-behind relationship as follows: Step 1: Compare the Z coordinates of the centers. Z_A = 2.75, Z_B = 1.37 Step 2: Determine if person is in front of or behind of orange/tangerine. Since Z_A = 2.75 > Z_B = 1.37, and we are considering the opposite view, person is in front of orange/tangerine. </think> That is False."
